# sendemail
new version of sendemail that can send one attachment

based on sendemail by Peter Gorasz

02/16/2020  Modified by Ed Williams to support sending one attachment (its what I needed)   

the files needed are: sendemail.h and sendemail.cpp

the other files (TestSendEmail.ino and KittyFishing.jpg) are for testing
