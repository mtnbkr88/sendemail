# sendemail
A new very simple version of sendemail that can send multiple buffer or file attachments.

Based on sendemail by Peter Gorasz.

05/07/2020  Modified by Ed Williams to support sending multiple buffer and/or file attachments. 

The files needed are: sendemail.h and sendemail.cpp

The other files (TestSendEmail.ino and KittyFishing.jpg) are for testing.
